## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
The dataset is refined to ensure structure and accuracy. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, formatting data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. These steps ensure the dataset is clean and prepared for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand data distribution, relationships, and patterns. Statistical summaries and visualizations help identify trends, correlations, and anomalies, guiding the selection of suitable models.

### 3. Model Development
A suitable machine learning model is selected based on the dataset. The workflow includes algorithm selection, training, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to ensure stable and accurate predictive performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. These metrics offer a clear understanding of how well the model performs and how reliably it generalizes to unseen data.

## Results and Insights

The final model demonstrates strong predictive capability and consistent performance across evaluation metrics. The analysis reveals meaningful insights and provides a clear understanding of data patterns, helping support informed interpretation and decision-making.
